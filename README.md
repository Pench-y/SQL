# What is SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. To get the most of the mounds of data they collect, many businesses must become versed in SQL. Companies and other organizations use SQL programs to access and manipulate information and data in their databases and to create and modify new tables. To understand SQL well, it is good to know what a **database** is.

A **database** in general is anything that groups information and that this has a sense, an example of this is:

- Supermarket list ðŸ›’
- task list :clipboard:
- contact list :busts_in_silhouette:
- User ig/tw :globe_with_meridians:

The important thing about a **database** is that it has data and that it can be related to each other.

# Data Storage

Data can be stored on different sides:
- Memory ðŸ§ 
- sheet ðŸ“ƒ
- Computer :computer:

When dealing with computers, this uses special software (RDBMS), such as:
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Oracle
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server

The different software allows **database** manipulation.
